# CloudCat
## Description
A Python script using an Ansible base to automate the creation and deletion of AWS EC2 instances for cloud-based password cracking!

Building and maintaing your own crackstation is fun, but can be seriously time consuming. If you're penetration testing or red teaming and you've captured some NTLMv2 hashes or an SPN, sometimes you need results quick.

If you can afford your own beefy crackstation then that's no problem - but if you can't justify purchasing a proper one then AWS might be the answer for you. Enhanced computing EC2 instances have some seriously fast GPUs, which are unsurprisingly ideal for cracking hashes. Here are some stats for the 3 EC2 instances supported by CloudCat.

tl;dr: Don't have the money or can't be bothered to maintain your own crackstation? Have some cash to spare? Want creds quickly? Automate cracking in the cloud and free up time to continue pentesting.
